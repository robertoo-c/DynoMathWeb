            <div class="bio">My name is Roberto Castro and currently a senior attending Bishop Alemany High School. I am also currently part of the Varsity Soccer team. Bishop Alemany has been blessed by being able to be one of the few high schools to offer the AP Capstone program, of which I have been enrolled in since my freshman year. Even during the hours when I am not at school for class, I want to continue to make an impact. I participate in Pan de Vida at St. Jane Francis de Chantal Church to package and donate food for needy families in our community. In addition, when I am not at the church, my love for coding sparked this new project I plan to work on in the upcoming months.</div>

AP Capstone is built on the foundation of two AP courses — AP Seminar and AP Research — and is designed to complement and enhance the in-depth, discipline-specific study experienced in other AP courses...<br>In AP Research, students cultivate the skills and discipline necessary to conduct independent research in order to produce and defend a scholarly academic paper."<br>College Board</div>
